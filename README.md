# TodoV Application Project Documentation

## Project Tagline
**"Your simple and effective task management solution."**

## Project Overview
The TodoV application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks with a clean and minimal user interface. The application supports local storage for saving tasks, ensuring that users can access their tasks even after refreshing the page. Additionally, it offers a light/dark theme toggle and filtering options for enhanced usability.
